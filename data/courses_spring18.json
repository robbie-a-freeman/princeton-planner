This course departs from this view and discusses how inefficiencies arise due to psychology and limits to arbitrage. The psychology of investors shapes their preferences and may impair their judgment. Whether these psychological factors have an impact on financial markets ultimately depends on arbitrageurs' ability to fight against mispricings. These issues will be covered through lectures and class games and will allow discussions about cognitive illusions and speculative bubbles.", "classes": [{"classnum": "41835", "enroll": "25", "limit": "40", "starttime": "03:00:00 pm", "section": "L01", "endtime": "04:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "101", "days": "TTh", "bldg": "Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building"}, {"classnum": "41837", "enroll": "13", "limit": "20", "starttime": "01:30:00 pm", "section": "P01", "endtime": "02:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "A97", "days": "T", "bldg": "Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building"}, {"classnum": "41838", "enroll": "10", "limit": "20", "starttime": "01:30:00 pm", "section": "P02", "endtime": "02:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "A12", "days": "M", "bldg": "Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building"}, {"classnum": "44399", "enroll": "0", "limit": "0", "starttime": "07:30:00 pm", "section": "P03", "endtime": "08:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "", "days": "M", "bldg": ""}, {"classnum": "44401", "enroll": "2", "limit": "25", "starttime": "07:30:00 pm", "section": "P04", "endtime": "08:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "", "days": "T", "bldg": ""}]},

This is especially true for activities associated with energy production, water use, and food production. To understand the environmental impacts, quantitative modeling tools are needed. This course introduces quantitative modeling approaches for environmental systems, including global models for carbon cycling; local and regional models for water, soil, and vegetation interactions; and models for transport of pollutants in both water and air. Students will develop simple models for all of these systems, and apply the models to a set of practical problems.", "classes": [{"classnum": "42925", "enroll": "26", "limit": "30", "starttime": "01:30:00 pm", "section": "L01", "endtime": "02:50:00 pm", "roomnum": "A07", "days": "MW", "bldg": "Jadwin Hall"}, {"classnum": "43826", "enroll": "13", "limit": "15", "starttime": "11:00:00 am", "section": "P01", "endtime": "11:50:00 am", "roomnum": "306", "days": "Th", "bldg": "Lewis Library"}, {"classnum": "43827", "enroll": "13", "limit": "15", "starttime": "01:30:00 pm", "section": "P02", "endtime": "02:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "306", "days": "Th", "bldg": "Lewis Library"}]},

Students will explore the science underlying these issues as well as current policies and the range of future policy responses.", "classes": [{"classnum": "42508", "enroll": "95", "limit": "105", "starttime": "10:00:00 am", "section": "L01", "endtime": "10:50:00 am", "roomnum": "100", "days": "TTh", "bldg": "Robertson Hall"}, {"classnum": "44290", "enroll": "17", "limit": "15", "starttime": "11:00:00 am", "section": "P01", "endtime": "11:50:00 am", "roomnum": "015", "days": "T", "bldg": "Robertson Hall"}, {"classnum": "44291", "enroll": "17", "limit": "15", "starttime": "11:00:00 am", "section": "P02", "endtime": "11:50:00 am", "roomnum": "023", "days": "T", "bldg": "Robertson Hall"}, {"classnum": "44292", "enroll": "10", "limit": "15", "starttime": "02:30:00 pm", "section": "P03", "endtime": "03:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "204", "days": "T", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "44293", "enroll": "11", "limit": "15", "starttime": "03:30:00 pm", "section": "P04", "endtime": "04:20:00 pm", "roomnum": "204", "days": "T", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "44294", "enroll": "18", "limit": "15", "starttime": "10:00:00 am", "section": "P05", "endtime": "10:50:00 am", "roomnum": "010", "days": "W", "bldg": "Robertson Hall"}, {"classnum": "44295", "enroll": "11", "limit": "15", "starttime": "11:00:00 am", "section": "P06", "endtime": "11:50:00 am", "roomnum": "005", "days": "W", "bldg": "Robertson Hall"}, {"classnum": "44296", "enroll": "11", "limit": "15", "starttime": "09:00:00 am", "section": "P07", "endtime": "09:50:00 am", "roomnum": "005", "days": "Th", "bldg": "Robertson Hall"}]},
