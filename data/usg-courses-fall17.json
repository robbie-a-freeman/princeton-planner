Laboratories and fieldwork will explore the process of translating observations and data into an understanding of how the natural world works."}, "classes": [{"status": "Open", "capacity": "60", "schedule": {"meetings": [{"start_time": "11:00 AM", "meeting_number": "1", "end_time": "12:20 PM", "days": ["T", "Th"]}], "start_date": "2017-09-13", "end_date": "2018-01-16"}, "section": "L01", "type_name": "Lecture", "class_number": "20130", "enrollment": "0"}, {"status": "Open", "capacity": "24", "schedule": {"meetings": [{"start_time": "01:30 PM", "meeting_number": "1", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "days": ["Th"]}], "start_date": "2017-09-13", "end_date": "2018-01-16"}, "section": "B01", "type_name": "Lab", "class_number": "20132", "enrollment": "0"}, {"status": "Open", "capacity": "24", "schedule": {"meetings": [{"start_time": "01:30 PM", "meeting_number": "1", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "days": ["F"]}], "start_date": "2017-09-13", "end_date": "2018-01-16"}, "section": "B02", "type_name": "Lab", "class_number": "20134", "enrollment": "0"}, {"status": "Open", "capacity": "24", "schedule": {"meetings": [{"start_time": "01:30 PM", "meeting_number": "1", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "days": ["W"]}], "start_date": "2017-09-13", "end_date": "2018-01-16"}, "section": "B03", "type_name": "Lab", "class_number": "20131", "enrollment": "0"}, {"status": "Open", "capacity": "24", "schedule": {"meetings": [{"start_time": "01:30 PM", "meeting_number": "1", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "days": ["T"]}], "start_date": "2017-09-13", "end_date": "2018-01-16"}, "section": "B04", "type_name": "Lab", "class_number": "20133", "enrollment": "0"}], "subj_code": "EEB", "course_id": "001538", "guid": "1182001538", "term_name": "17-18 Fall"}, {"subj_name": "Ecology and Evol Biology", "catalog_number": "327", "crosslistings": [{"catalog_number": "327", "subject": "MOL"}], "title": "Immune Systems: From Molecules to Populations", "instructors": [{"last_name": "Graham", "first_name": "Andrea Linn", "emplid": "960470270", "full_name": "Andrea Linn Graham"}], "term_code": 1182, "detail": {"track": "UGRD", "start_date": "2017-09-13", "end_date": "2018-01-16", "description": "How do immune systems work, and why do they work as they do?
