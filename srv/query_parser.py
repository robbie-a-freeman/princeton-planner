# This program takes in an *unsanitized* query string from the user,
# sanitizes it to reduce the risk of injection-style attacks, and
# then generates a MongoDB query that will search the database to satisfy
# the user's queryself.

# This program is not responsible for: processing the POST server query,
# Sending the MongoDB query to MongoDB, or receiving the results of the mongodb
# query, or repackaging the results for use in the frontend HTMLself.


# ======================================================================
#   Query String Types: (all case-insensitive)
#
#   Any three letters XYZ that are a valid dept. id (e.g COS)
#       Match against "listings" : [ {"dept": XYZ} ]
#
#   Any three numbers 000:
#       Match against "listings" : [ {"dept": 000}]
#
#   Any two letters XY that are a valid distr. req. (e.g. QR, EM)
#       Match against "area" : XY
#
#   Any other string X(Y) (len <= 2) NOT a distr. or dept. id:
#       Match against "title" : X(Y) OR
#       match against dept id: "listings" : [ {"dept": XY} ]
#
#   Any other string (not dept id, not distr, len >= 3)
#       match against  Match against "title" : str
