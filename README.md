Current Priorities
===================
- Configure Vagrant so it can run scraper.py and a MongoDB server
- Input the results of scraper.py into the MongoDB server
- Input all.yaml from CourseGenie into the MongoDB server (possibly by first parsing into json)
- Finalize frontend design and begin to implement
