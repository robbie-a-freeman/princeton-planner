Current Priorities
===================
- Configure Vagrant so it can run utils/scraper.py and a MongoDB server
- Input the results of utils/scraper.py into the MongoDB server
- Input data/all.yaml from CourseGenie into the MongoDB server (possibly by first parsing into json)
- Finalize frontend design and begin to implement
- Set up Heroku Server and then finalize frameworks (what is a framework???)
